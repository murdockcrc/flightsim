### BGKK - CYFB

Another long water crossing, and the last one for a while.

This flight takes us from Greenland to Canada, and we are now officially out of Europe and in North America.

As I fly these routes, I've taken up the habit of researching these places in Wikipedia. The guiding principle behind the routes for this trip around the world is to ensure each leg is within range of the aircraft (duh\!). Since this is a single-engine propeller aircraft, that range is not particularly large, so some of these airports were chosen just for the sake of making sure we don't run out of fuel. They are not the typical famous, large airhub, but rather rural aerodromes. So I've developed an interested in learning more about these places, which I will probably never get to see in real life.

Iqaluit is Canada aboriginal territory, as you can see from the name:

The thing that will strike you about northern Canada is how incredibly desolate it is. Some of these town are not event connected to the rest of Canada by roads, but rather by boat, train or airplanes. It makes me wonder how do people live here. What do they do for a living? How is it living in such a remote place? Are there advantages to it?
