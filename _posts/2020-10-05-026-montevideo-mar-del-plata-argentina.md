_Just after takeoff from Montevideo airport_

Since we came into Montevideo at night, we did not have the chance to explore the city from up in the air. This is our chance to do so:

We are leaving Montevideo, the capital of Uruguay. But not before doing a VFR departue and taking some shots of the city:![](/images/027_sumu-sazm_02.jpg)

For this flight, we are taking out the Beechcraft Bonanza G36. Why not the TBM? I don't know, I wanted to take things slower and a Beechcraft seemed like a good fit.
