### EGPO - BIKF

First time crossing a big area of water.

The departure from Scotland offered the typical Scotish weather: dark, rainy and windy.

The TBM is equipped with a Garmin 3000 flight management system. Despite the fact that I was crossing a large body of water (with no visual elements or radio navigational aids), having a GPS-powered flight computer makes navigation a breeze.

Long gone are the days when you had to jump from one VOR to another one. When crossing large distances over water, you would typically have to travel some distance without any VOR radio reception, meaning you just had to trust you were on the right VOR radial, kept the heading straight, and that crosswinds didn't move you too much to one side or the other. Eventually, your aircraft would get the radio signal from the next VOR at the other side of the pond, and you could check how right (or wrong) your position was).

Approaching into Iceland was nice, but the MSFS has a bug and the game crashes when you get close to the Keflavik airspace. It is impossible to land or takeoff from BIKF for now.
