### KNIP - KMIA

Following the east coast of the United States is beautiful. That narrow strip of land sandwiched between the ocean and the mainland is quite nice decoration. Postcard image:

For this flight, I tuned in Vatsim and got my first real ATC flight. Jacksonville had coverage and I tuned in for my IFR flight. Watching [YouTube videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBWVfz6GEgk){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"} to learn how to do ATC on the radio was quite helpful. I did not make any mistakes and did not. get scolded once. Success\!

Here are some views from the approach to Miami. Coming in from the water and into the airport, I made sure to have some nice views of the city:

As you can see from the image below, I botched the approach to KMIA. I came in way too high and had to turn around and lose altitude:

Again, some nice views of the drone from KMIA:

IRL (in real life), I've been to KMIA dozens of time. It's one of the busiest airports in the USA. It takes the largest share of flights coming in from Latin America. Not an airport I would recommend, it's way too busy and the lines at the immigration desks are crazy long.
