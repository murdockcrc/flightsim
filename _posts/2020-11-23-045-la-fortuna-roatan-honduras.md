_MRAN - MHRO_

_El Tanque - Aeropuerto Internacional Juan Manuel Gálvez_

We leave my home country, Costa Rica, and head up north to Honduras. But not the normal Honduras. We are heading up to a special place, Roatan.

Roatan is a tourist destination in Honduras, and a paradise for those able to dive in the waters of the Caribbean Sea.

As we cross through the north of Costa Rica and into Nicaraguan territory, we are in the middle of the deep, tropical jungle. Long-gone are the days of arid, high-altitude desert, high-elevation airports, and cold temperatures. We are now dealing with sea-level altitudes, hot temperatures and very high humidity, and the freshness and greenness of the tropical rain forest.

As we cross into Honduras from Nicaragua, we can admire the rugged landscape of the country. About 80% of Honduras's surface is mountainous territory. Roatan is an island off the north coast of the country, so we need to cross the isthmus from one side to the other. As we do this, we have a spectacular view of the Cordillera Nombre de Dios:

Right off the Cordillera there is La Ceiba. If you pay attention the following picture, you will see La Ceiba's airport too:

We pass over La Ceiba and get feet wet again. Roatan is just 30nm off the coast of Honduras, so it's not long before we have the island in sight:

And we land in a beautiful, tropical paradise:

Roatan is served by the _Juan Manuel Gálvez_ International airport and is world-famous scuba diving destination. Roatan sits in the Mesoamerican Barrier Reef System, the second-largest barrier reef in the world. Check out yourselves some of the Wikipedia pages of the wonderful Roatan beaches and some of the marine life available underwater in the barrier reef.
