### TNCS - TTPP

_Juancho E. Yrausquin Airport - Piarco International Airport_

We continue our journey south to enter into South America. Just one stop more into Trinidad & Tobago until we exit the Caribbean islands and make it into mainland South America.

The departure from Saba was as interesting as the arrival. With only 300m of runway to achieve rotation speed, you need to make sure you don't waste any meter of runway and as you speed up to take off:

What a gorgeous trip this was. I took off with the Cessna without any problems, and enjoyed majestic views as I got farther and farther away from Saba:

According to Wikipedia, Saba is the highest point in the whole Kingdom of the Netherlands. Go figure that out.

The Cessna 172 is a nice plane, but it's slow. So I made some flightsim magic and switched to the TBM mid-air. Ain't that nice?

The approach to Port of Spain was uneventful
