### KMIA - MYNN

So that's it folks, we are out of the United States. KMIA was our last stop before heading over to the Caribbean. We will come back to the USA later, this time through the west coast.

Nassau is the main city of The Bahamas. It is served by the Lynden Pindling International Airport.&nbsp;

You can tell you are in the Caribbean simply by looking at the color of the water:

The approaches are colorful and entertaining. On final approach, I swear I could see some of the beach hotels on the shoreline:

With no wind and clear skies, the final approach and landing was textbook smooth.
