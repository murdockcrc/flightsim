### TTPP - SBBV

_Piarco International Airport - Boa Vista International Airport_

That's it for us in the Caribbean. I'm sure we missed a lot of lovely places in this area, but we can't hang around for too long in a single region, we've got a world to explore.

We will cross Venezuela and land at Boa Vista in Brazil. We will continue through the eastern part of the South American subcontinent until we reach its end at Ushuaia. But there's still a couple of stop before we get there.

_View of Port of Spain during the initial climb. Ok, that AOA (Angle of Attack) was kind of aggressive, but the TBM can take whatever you throw at it._

I use the sim with Live Weather. Users in the forum has been reporting that the weather conditions have issues and are not realistic. We'll see if Microsoft introduces an update to fix this. But for now, we have enjoyed a couple of legs with incredible weather.
