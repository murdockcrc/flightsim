### SBAT - SBBR

_Alta Floresta Airport - Presidente Juscelino Kubitschek International Airport_

We are getting out of Alta Floresta:

If you haven't noticed, I've changed the livery of the TBM to match the colors of my country. Red white and blue. Actually, the name of this livery is "Great Britain", but let's just pretend this is symbolic of the Costa Rican flag :D

We start our approach to Brasilia. Brasilia is the capital city of Brazil. It's located more centrally inside the country (compared to the big and famous coastal cities of Salvador, Rio or Sao Paulo). At 3498 feet, this is the highest altitude we will land on during our trip (though that's going to change when we land in Bolivia!)

This time, I broke off from the route and cancelled by IFR approach to Brasilia. Instead, I provided with a city tour VFR flight to explore the city. In real life, what I did would have been highly illegal: The minimums around close distance to the airport are 5600ft, and the city center is to be avoided from air traffic. I flew right into the city center at 5000ft. None of this matters in the flight sim, and that's good thing:

_Estádio Nacional Mané Garrincha. It is Brazil's second-largest stadium (in terms of spectator capacity), and was host to the 2013 FIFA's Confederations Cup and the 2014 FIFA World Cup. The stadium seems to be buried in the ground in the sim, maybe something the dev team at Microsoft should look at..._

_Time to go home. View of the Brasilia airport. I flew right past the airport, and made a teardrop visual approach into runway 11R._
