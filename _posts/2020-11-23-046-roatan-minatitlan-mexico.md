_MHRO - MMMT_

_Aeropuerto Internacional Juan Manuel Gálvez - Aeropuerto Internacional de Minatitlán_

The weather was crap in Roatan. It's not unusual, it's a place that sees lots of rainfall during the year. Particularly this time of the year, when the hurricane season is just finishing, but lots of rainfall still comes in from the Caribbean Sea.

However, the cloud ceiling is supposed to be low, so we should break out into the sun soon:

As our flight level for the day is 25000ft, we soon find ourselves over the ceiling and looking into clear, blue skies:

As I take off from Roatan, it dawns on me how small Central America is. It's tiny. Considering the multiple flights needed to get out of Canada, Brasil, Argentina, Chile... we are done with the Central American Isthmus in 2 stops (Costa Rica and Honduras).

We are now on our way to Mexico.

Minatitlan is in the state of Veracruz. The airport is a small one, and although it offers a VOR navigational aid, it does not have an ILS, so the approach and landing needs to be manual. The weather is excellent in Mexico, so that is not a problem. As we come in from the east, but the runway in operation is runway 07, we first fly over the airport at 2000ft and proceed to do a teardrop approach:

Nothing unusual here, although the terrain does not look as green as it was between Colombia and Honduras. We are heading north, and the tropical jungle gets less dense:

I recognize that, if we keep on going like this, we will reach Canada and Alaska in December, and I am not sure it is a clever idea to fly into Canada-Alaska-Russia during winter months. If this were real life, I would probably avoid doing that. We'll see what the weather has for us as we move up north. For now, there is still a long way to go until we get there.
