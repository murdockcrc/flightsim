### SBCT - SUMU

_Afonso Pena International Airport - Carrasco/General Ces√°reo L. Berisso International Airport_

We are leaving Brazil. Finally. We have not done so many legs inside one single country. The last time we did so many was in Canada, and that was a while ago. We leave Brazil and do a brief stop in Uruguay's capital, Montevideo.

_Just out of runway 33 in Curitiba_

We are coming into Montevideo at night:

We had a 30-knot cross wind on final approach, that's why you see that the direction of flight is not aligned with the direction of the runway. This is done to compensate for the strong wind blowing us off to the right:

The TBM fared well in the cross wind, and the touchdown was smooth and easy.

Next stop will be Argentina, another country which will require a bunch of legs within its borders!
