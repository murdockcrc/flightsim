### SBBV - SBEG

_Boa Vista International - Eduardo Gomes International Airport_

Brazil is massive. It's obvious from looking at it in any world map, but when you are flying through it for hours, only to realise you haven't really progressed much across the same country. Same feeling as flying through Canada or the USA.

We leave Boa Vista to continue south to Manaus

Manaus is the capital city of the Amazonas state in Brazil. We are here in deep tropical jungle territory. It all looks so abstract from a height of 27000 feet. Perhaps the satellite images from Bing are not that detailed as in other parts of the world, therefore the lack of texture.

Still, the approach to Manaus makes it really clear that you are in tropical territory.
