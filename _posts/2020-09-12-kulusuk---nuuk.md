The flights from Europe to the west coast of the USA typically fly over Iceland, cross over Greenland, and go south over northern Canada. Depending on the time of your departure, you can end up seeing the sunrise over Greenland, at some 30'000ft of altitude.

The Greenland landscape is one of the most spectacular sceneries I've ever since in real life. Cruising at 30'000ft or more, Greenland shows up as an endless landscape of high rocky snowy mountains. It is endlessly white and tremendously mountainous. It's surreal and out of this world.

So I was naturally to see how this impressive landscape shows up in the sim. The flight from Kulusuk to Nuuk takes your from the east coast to the west coast of Greenland, crossing the island from one side to the other. Unfortunately, this landscape in the same is completely underwhelming. It just looks like a flat white table, with out-of-place lakes here and there. Too bad I did not take a picture. Presumably, the resolution and quality of the satellite images from Bing for Greenland are not the greatest. That kind of makes sense. No point in investing a lot of effort in mapping this part of the world, if Bing Maps does not have a commercial incentive to do it.
