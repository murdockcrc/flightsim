_Aeropuerto Internacional de Minatitlán - Aeropuerto Internacional de San Luis Potosí_

We leave the lowlands of Veracruz and proceed nortwest to the center of Mexico. Our destination: San Luis Potosi.

Mexico can be quite mountainous, as it's home to the Sierra Madre, a 2'350km-long cordillera than crosses the country from northwest to southeast. Our last 2 stops in Mexico will be across this mountain range.

San Luis Potosi airport lies at 6035ft if altitude. Not crazy high as during our Andean trip, but also not sea level. As we approach San Luis Potosi, we'll get some nice views of the Sierra Madre Oriental.
