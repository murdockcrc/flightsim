_MMMT - MMSP_

_Aeropuerto Internacional de Minatitlán - Aeropuerto Internacional de San Luis Potosí_

We leave the lowlands of Veracruz and proceed northwest to the center of Mexico. Our destination: San Luis Potosi.

As we leave Minatitlan, we get some nice views of the Gulf of Mexico:

Mexico can be quite mountainous, as it's home to the Sierra Madre, a 2'350km-long cordillera than crosses the country from northwest to southeast. Our last  stop in Mexico will be across this mountain range.

As we get deeper in the Sierra Madre, the landscape gets more arid. Long-gone are the days of tropical rain forest

San Luis Potosi airport lies at 6035ft if altitude. Not crazy high as during our Andean trip, but also not sea level. As we approach San Luis Potosi, we'll get some nice views of the Sierra Madre Oriental.

Again, we come into the airport from the wrong direction (the runway of landing is pointing in the opposite heading), so we fly over the airfield at 10000ft and proceed to execute a teardrop approach:

Not much to report on the landing itself. The airport has ILS on this runway. Time to land, refuel, and take off to our next destination: El Paso, TX.
