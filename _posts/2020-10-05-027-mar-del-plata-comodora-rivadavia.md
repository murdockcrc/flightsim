### SAZM - SAVC

_Aeropuerto Internacional de Mar del Plata "Ástor Piazzolla - Aeropuerto Internacional General Enrigue Mosconi_

We continue our journey southwards, destination Comodoro Rivadavia.

We depart Mar del Plata and traverse the east coast of Argentina. The scenery looks like a very remote, deserted place, with no forests and mostly arid terrain. That is because we are traversing the Patagonia, a scarcely populated area in the south of Argentina.

We land at Comodora Rivadavia. Colloqually simply as "Comodoro", this is the third largest city in the Argentinian Patagonia, with close to 200000 inhabitants.

Comodoro gets its name from the Argentinian Commodore Martín Rivadavia. The city is an important hub for Argentina's petroleum production. Oil was found in the area in 1903, and since then the city prospered as a source of hydrocarbon revenue for the state.
