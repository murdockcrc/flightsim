### MYNN - MTPP

We are taking off from Nassau on a beautiful sunny day with absolute clear skies.

The airspace around Nassau had very little traffic, which allows ATCs and pilots to have more casual conversations over the radio (something you can't do on busy airports because of radio congestion).

The flight over the Caribbean was breath-taking:
