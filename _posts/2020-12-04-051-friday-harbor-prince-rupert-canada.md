KFHR - CYPR

Prince Rupert will be our only stop in Canada's west coast.

We depart the USA right at dawn, and get the see some nice views of the west coast during the early morning lights:

Once at a cruising altitude of 25'000ft, the winds are very strong (over 50kts) and the turbulence quite hard. So I lower the altitude to 20'000 to see if the air calms down a bit there. Not much luck either.

As we cruise along the Canadian west coastline, we get incredible views of the mountains to the east:

The arrival at Prince Rupert is plagued with dense fog, low ceilings, and low visibility. This was to be expected. It is winter in the northern hemisphere, so the more north we go, the worse the weather will turn.

The landing at Prince Rupert is exciting: with a headwind of 19kts and wind gusts of 29kts, the planes is shaken badly during the last stage of our final approach. Don't know about you, but in real life, you don't want your plane to be shaken in the air when you are at only 500ft above ground, coming in slow and losing altitude by the second. The landing was good though, I am getting better at this :)
