### SAWH - SAWC

_Aeropuerto Internacional de Ushuaia Malvinas Argentinas - Comandante Armando Tola International Airport_

We start our first leg north, going out from Ushuaia towards El Calafate.

We take off from the runway at Ushuaia, and need to go up north through the Martial mountains. A trip you can use to get to altitude in a short distance is to turn around while climbing. In this case, right after takeoff I make a turn south and do a 360 degree over the airport (while climbing), so we are at good altitude as we approach the Martial mountains

Our route to El Calafate will put us through one of the wonders of this planet: the Torres del Paine National Park.

Torres del Paine is a very famous spot for mountaineering and hiking, and it is a place I definitively would like to check out by myself one day. For now, we will do that in the sim though.

We interrupt our IFR flight right over Puerto Natales in Chile, and continue on VFR over the Torres del Paine National Park:

El Calafate is on the Argentinian side, and it is a gateway into the Torres del Paine area.

The overall scenery is, honestly, underwhelming. It might be that the satellite resolution of Bing maps is not too precise, but I was expecting the scenery of El Calafate to be more accurate with the colorful town itself, and the mountains in the National Park to be more detailed. Anyway, it is what it is and we came into the airport safe and sound.
