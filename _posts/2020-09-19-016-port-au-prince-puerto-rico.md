### MTPP - TJSJ

Today's flight takes us from the capital of Haiti, to Puerto Rico's main airport: Luis Muñoz Marin Intl in San Juan. But we are going to take the sim out for the spin in a different manner. Let's see how it performs on a sunrise.

So we take off Port-au-Prince in the dark, under perfect conditions for IFR flying:

We are targeting a cruise altitude of 27000ft (FL270), which we reach rather easy on the TBM. This is a plane which is not shy to climb up fast. In fact, it can climb faster than it can stabilise the cabin's pressure, so you would typically want to be less aggressive with the ascents.

By the time we reach cruise altitude, the sun is rewarding us with all the glory of an astonishing sunrise.

This is a..ma..zing. Speechless. What Microsoft has done with the scenery, topography, lighting conditions and reflections, camera flare, is nothing else but magic. At these times when traveling is difficult, quarantine and border restrictions are the norm, it is so refreshing to travel the world like this, even if only virtually. I've enjoyed these views as much as any other real-world view I've seen before. During these COVID times, the sim gives me the possibility to travel.

I have so many good friends in Puerto Rico. The land of Salsa and Reggaeton. I love them both. And I have not seen my friends from PR in a crazy long time. It was a time to be nostalgic, trying to remember how nice it would be to meet these fellows again, and enjoy the wonderful environment of Puerto Rico.

_Algún otro día, mis panas, nos vamos a ver cara a cara otra vez, y a disfrutar juntos._
