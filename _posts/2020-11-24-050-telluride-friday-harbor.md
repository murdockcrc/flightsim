KTEX - KFHR

We are making our way to our last stop in the continuous USA for the entire world trip. We will come back to the USA when we hit Alaska, but this is it.

We head towards Washington state, an area that is very close to my heart as I've been never countless times. In my past, I used to work for Microsoft, which required me to visit the Redmond campus a couple of times per year.

The departure from Telluride is nice, with great views of the irregular terrain:

As we enter Washington state, we get an emblematic view of Mt. Rainier. I say emblematic because if you've flown over the state in winter, this view if very typical: fog and clouds all around you, with Mt. Rainier sticking up from the fog in all its glory:

Mt. Rainier is an active volcano with a summit at 4,392m. It's beautiful in the summer. The highlight of flying on the pacific northwest if you ask me.

For the landing, I chose the Friday harbor airfield. Friday Habor is located in the San Juan Islands archipelago, which is another gorgeous region in Washington state. Beautiful landscapes adorned with water all around them, it's a great place for whale watching and enjoying some time off from the craziness of the city during a weekend break.
