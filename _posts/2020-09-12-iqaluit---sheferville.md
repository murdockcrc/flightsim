### CYFB - CYKL

561nm (nautical miles, roughly 1'038km) of,,, nothingness.

Winters must be really rough in Canada. Particularly this north up in Canada. You are basically flying for over 1'000 kilometers and there is nothing but emptiness. It's beautiful in a certain way. Dense forests, hilly landscapes and lots and lots of water (lakes and rivers).

Sheferville is a town of 213 people. It used to be a much bigger town, when there was a large iron ore mining operation there. The mine was closed in the 1980's and since then the population has been continuously coming down.

At this point, I really have no clue what these people do up there. A quick landing for refuelling, and up in the air we go again.&nbsp;
