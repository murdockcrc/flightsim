Let's take a look at Toronto.

We are departing from the Temiscanie River aerodrome and going south to Toronto. We are arriving at Toronto Billy Bishop airport, which sits right next to the city. This is not Toronto's main airport. In general, we are avoiding large airports as much as we can.

We say goodbye to the emptiness of norther Canada, and hit our first major city so far in the country:

The approach to Toronto was awesome. Beautiful scenery and great weather too. This time, I am flying the Hungarian flag livery on the TBM, which you can find [HERE](https://www.nexusmods.com/microsoftflightsimulator/mods/25){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"}.&nbsp;

The sim crashed on final approach, so I had to respawn the sim again close to the airport and try it again.

I also took the opportunity to use the drone and explore the place a bit. I have no clue how Microsoft is rendering major cities like Toronto, but the amount of detail present here is awesome. It's really a feat of engineering.
