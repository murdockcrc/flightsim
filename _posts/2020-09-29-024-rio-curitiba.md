### SBGL - SBCT

_Rio de Janeiro/Galeão – Antonio Carlos Jobim International Airport - Afonso Pena International Airport_

We are departing from Rio in runway 15 and following a SID departure that will take us through the east of the city, then turning south towards a south-west direction. This kind of takes us on a circle around the city of Rio de Janeiro:

Our destination is Curitiba. Never heard of Curitiba? Me neither. One of the nice things about this world tour is the opportunity to discover new places in the world, places of which I've never heard before (and most likely will never visit in real life either!).

Curitiba is a city in the south part of Brazil, in the state of Paraná. This will be our last stop in Brazil (our next leg will take us to Uruguay). It's a city with close to million people. That's right, 2 million! Curitiba was a host city for both the 1950 and the 2014 FIFA World Cups. Without knowing, we turned our Brazil flight trip as a little pilgrimage through Brazilian World Cup history :-)

_Quite a big city, ain't it?_

We are approaching the Afonso Pena using the STAR ORAN1C arrival for runway 33.
