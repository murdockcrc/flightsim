_Port Stanley Airport - Aeropuerto Internacional de Ushuaia Malvinas Argentinas_

We leave the British oversees territory of Falkland Islands and continue south west towards Ushuaia.

I have noticed that, the more south you go, the worse the weather tends to get. Don't know if this is also true in real life, but if it is, it is something you definitively want to plan for. The clouds are heavier and higher, the high-altitude wind is crazy, and the winds at land are also no joke, especially if they force you to do a crosswind landing procedure. Just look at this screen, showing winds of 101kts at 27000ft:

Long gone are the days of beautiful clear skies, no wind, and warm temperatures. I got used to these conditions since we started off Miami. Since that flight, and all the way through the Caribbean and Brazil, the weather has been excellent. Not anymore. Winds are tough, temperatures drop off close to or below the freezing (which give way to icing conditions, see some of the pictures later in this post).

Ushuaia is the southernmost city in the world, barely north from the border with Chile. The approach to Ushuaia is beautiful, with the Martial mountain range to the north and the Beagle Channel to the south:

Better be careful with those mountains on the north. They are really steep and really close to the airfield. Usually is located in the region of Tierra de Fuego, and is a typical destination for those embarking on ships south to the Antarctic. This is also the place where the PanAmerican highway ends.

Ushuaia is served by the _Aeropuerto Internacional de Ushuaia Malvinas Argentinas_ airport. This is also the southernmost commercial airport in the world.

Similar to Port Stanley, we also need to fight a 33kts crosswind when approaching runway 25:

You can see a bunch of ice all around the place. The ground temperature is about 4C. I've turned on all the anti-ice features of the plane, but still ice forms in several places. Don't know if this is normal or if this is a bug in the sim.

From now on, we can't go any more to the south. Not even in real life. The next leg will take us back up to the north and start our journey through South America's west coast. This is going to be an interesting part of the trip, as we will visit some of the highest airports in the world, and some of the most desolate places too.
