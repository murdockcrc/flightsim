Inspired by this [Reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/MicrosoftFlightSim/comments/ibynim/cessna_172_world_tour_flight_plan_took_me_a_whole/){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, I have taken over the Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 and started a trip around the world.

In this Corona times, this seems like the most sensible way to travel the world safety (and cheaply).

It is also a chance to experience first hand the current state of technology. After a 10 year hiatus, Microsoft is back with the flightsim. This time, however, they are trying to do something quite revolutionary: use artificial intelligence to create realistic renderings of the earth, use Bing Maps satellite imagery to recreate the scenery of the world, and offer simulation visuals that have never been seen before.

I started in the flightsim world back in 1995 with the Microsoft FS 95. I have used FS 98, FSX and X-Plane too. I'm taking the best of Microsoft, a single aircraft plane (the Daher TBM 930) and explore the best virtual world there is today.
