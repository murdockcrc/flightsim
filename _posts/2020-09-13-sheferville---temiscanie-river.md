Taking off from Schefferville to a rural aerodrome in Quebec. According to Wikipedia, this place is usually operated during [winter months](https://www.google.ch/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiX5crG9ubrAhXnSRUIHa4FBv0QFjAAegQIAhAB&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FRivi%25C3%25A8re_T%25C3%25A9miscamie_&#40;Air_Roberval_Lt%25C3%25A9e&#41;_Aerodrome&amp;usg=AOvVaw3mhZOr51Sc-vuzRYoH-am6){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"}.

This was another instance of flying over the vast emptiness of northern Canada. This is the last such flight leg. After this, we are going to Toronto City, and then descending through the American continent's east coast (all the way to Ushuaia).

After these flight legs, this is my mental image of how the whole of northern Canada look like:

Dense forests, lots of water, mostly flat (or with minimal hills), and no human settlements whatsoever. Probably one of the few places on earth humanity has not managed to tame.
