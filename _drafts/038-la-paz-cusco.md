_EL Alto International Airport - Alejandro Velasco Astete International Airport_

Thought we were going to end the high-altitude landings just because we left Bolivia? Think again.

This trip takes us to Cusco, one of Latin America's most popular tourist destinations. The airport, located at 10860ft, is a high-altitude airport in Peru, and is named after the Peruvian aviation pioneer Alejandro Velasco Astete. He was the first person to cross the Andes in 1925, and tragically died in an accident during an airshow in Peru.

Our trip from La Paz to Cusco takes us right through the middle of Lake Titicaca. Titicaca is the largest lake in South America, and the highest lake in the world (at least from the ones with a surface big enough to be of significance, though there are other much smaller bodied of water in the world at higher altitudes).

The terrain is less rugged than in Bolivia, but we are still navigation altitudes above 10000ft, with mountain peaks and volcanoes which are much higher than that along the Andes.

Again, the weather is impeccable for this flight, which I attribute to the fact that it is summer down there and sunny, clear skies are the norm. But we are keeping on moving north and it's already the end of November, so weather will probably get bad once he hit central American and beyond (it's hurricane season over there right now).
